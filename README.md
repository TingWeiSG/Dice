# Dice
This is a sample of what I've learnt on DataCamp thus far.
For this, you will need matplotlib.pyplot and numby

Imagine you are walking up a high rise building, and you are playing a game with your friend.

Each person will roll a dice up to a hundred times. An action will be taken for each roll of the dice. 

1. For every roll result of 1 or 2, the person takes 1 step down.
2. For every roll result of 3, 4 or 5, the person takes 1 step up.
3. For every roll result of 6, the person to roll the dice again, and take steps equivalent to the new roll.
4. Lower bound of total steps taken cannot be lower than 0.
5. Chance of falling off the stairs (ie starting from step 0) due to clumsiness = 0.1%. 

What are the chances you will reach 60 steps?
